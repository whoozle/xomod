# Fully Featured Modular CHIP8 (XO/SuperCHIP) emulator.

This is a effectively a clone of John Earnest's work, who's running OCTOJAM contests (check it out if you love 8-bit programming). 

The original project, along with development tools, is available in his Octo repository:
https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo

A lot of games are available on http://www.awfuljams.com/

This emulator was designed to be modular and simple, suitable for running in embedded environments or in a terminal, using pseudographics.
The minimalistic backend API allows easy porting to new platforms or ways to render graphics.
